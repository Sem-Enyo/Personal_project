# Personal_project
Just a hub for my personal projects as I start out learning Data Analysis
#Time-series of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data.
#NDVI is a common vegetation index derived from satellite data 
#NDVI range from -1 to +1 with high values for high biomass
#The goal was to remove outliers by computing the median of NDVI in a window covering 7 time-periods
#Using the moving window to remove outliers by replacing them with the median of the window
